## Project Overview
This repository contains an interactive Excel dashboard and comprehensive report analyzing survey results for an organisation called Arc based in Sydney.The analysis is based on 2,535 responses collected from October 10-29, 2024, providing critical insights into engagement, membership patterns, and program effectiveness.

This dashboard was deliberately developed using just Microsoft Excel (Python for data cleaning) rather than more specialized data visualization tools for a **critical reason: stakeholder accessibility**. While more advanced visualization platforms were considered, the primary goal was to create an analytical tool that would be **actively used by all stakeholders, regardless of their technical expertise**.

-Immediate usability without additional training

-Ability for stakeholders to explore the data independently

-Easy sharing and modification within the organization's existing workflows

-Sustainable long-term use without specialized software dependencies



## Dashboard Features
The Excel dashboard provides:
- Interactive filtering by study level, domestic/international status, and year of study
- Demographic breakdowns (membership status, study level, living situation)
- Program engagement metrics and satisfaction ratings
- Social media preference analysis
- Priority analysis by student segment
