# Arc Student Experience Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository contains an interactive Excel dashboard and comprehensive report analyzing the Term 3 2024 student survey results for Arc, the student organization at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The analysis is based on 2,535 student responses collected from October 10-29, 2024, providing critical insights into student engagement, membership patterns, and program effectiveness.

This dashboard was deliberately developed using just Microsoft Excel (Python for data cleaning) rather than more specialized data visualization tools for a **critical reason: stakeholder accessibility**. While more advanced visualization platforms were considered, the primary goal was to create an analytical tool that would be **actively used by all stakeholders, regardless of their technical expertise**.

-Immediate usability without additional training

-Ability for stakeholders to explore the data independently

-Easy sharing and modification within the organization's existing workflows

-Sustainable long-term use without specialized software dependencies
